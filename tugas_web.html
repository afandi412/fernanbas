				<h1>The Impact of Social Media and the Effects of Cyber Bullying.</h1>
				<hr>
				<p align="justify">
					Riset indicate that more than 75% of all school-age minors are affected by social media, but at one point or another in the world (source).It's also the most difficult to catch and prosecute, as the anonymous nature of the internet can lead to threats coming from anywhere and from everyone who allows people the opportunity to do stuff they might never do in real life, as they can't threaten people face to face, or they can't get in trouble as easily,And the results of this can have an effect on the person being bullied terribly because they feel they are defenseless and have no way to combat the people who hurt them.Humans live in a world where people are being humiliated and abused. According to an anonymous report (2014), "Cyberbullying happens for many of the same reasons as any other type of bullying, but it may be even more appealing because it can be done anonymously". Cyberbullying is an act of using social media technologies to threaten others that are done anonymously in the main cases. By using cellphones or some other tool, such as computers and tablets, to connect to the Internet, a vast amount of people have spent their time bullying other people. Cyberbullying may not harm anyone physically; it may affect them psychologically instead.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					One of the key reasons Cyber-Bullying is triggered is the open existence of the internet, as said before. Studies reveal in a quote to Kowalski, Giumetti, Shroeder, and Latanner "They find that cyberbullies felt invisible, which gives them more motivation to be violent because they know they are alone, does not have any repercussions. Which is reality, if you want to say something horrible to someone in real life, or vent yourself to them, it is much easier to approach the person because of the simple human nature of meeting a person who can lash face to face, or because of the fear of getting in trouble when the person rats you out. With the internet, you can use that secret and mystical aspect to make a person feel strong, untouchable even though they believe they can't be harmed by someone or something, so no one can ever figure out who or where they are, hence never getting into trouble. They strike in terms that are far worse than they can in normal life, and that can hurt even more than any actual altercation therein.
				</p>			

				<p align="justify">
					On social media platforms such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter, cyberbullying will take place. "By 2008, 93% of young people aged 12 to 17 were online (source). Also, young people spend more time on the internet than any other activity except sleeping."The last decade has witnessed an increase in cyberbullying, which is categorized as bullying by using electronic communications technologies such as Email, instant messaging, social media, online gaming, or digital messages or images sent to a cell phone.Eight out of ten teens who use social media now share more information about themselves than they have in the past, according to a 2013 study by Pew Research. It includes their location, pictures, and contact information. It is important to keep personal information such as age, birthday, school/church, telephone number, etc. confidential to protect the children.Two 2014 reports showed that 80 percent of body-shaming tweets were sent by women, while they accounted for 50% of misogynistic tweets, too (Pew Research, 2014).Cyberbullying can also occur by the use of websites belonging to other individuals to effectively recommend that another person or group be targeted. The bullying of climate scientists and activists is an example of this.
				</p>

				<p align="justify">
					Some cases show that it is also a victim.For example, such as children who receive bullying by their siblings at home, then children respond by being bullied at school which they consider weaker than themselves.Another example is people who are depressed due to bullying in real life and use the internet and cyberspace to prove that it also has power by attacking others.
				</p>

				<p>
					The consequences of cyberbullying are much the same, as some other form of bullying.For people who are doing cyberbullying, if they get caught, a bad reputation awaits them in the future.Since cyberbullying is also an act of bullying, there is a law for it and if they have sufficient proof, the victims may report the case. As for those that develop cyberbullying, they get stressed out. It will push them to do harmful things and one of them abuses alcohol intakes or even narcotics. Teenagers will miss school because they are reluctant to attend and meet people, thinking it's hard to talk, other people would laugh and pick them up instead. They begin to doubt others, to blame and judge people one by one. They did lock themselves up in their room or, worse, attempt suicide.
